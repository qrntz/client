# 0.6.2

- Depends on `wireleap/common` v0.3.6.

- Improvements to upgrade status handling code:
    - Upgrade status no longer assumed on start/stop.
    - If starting `wireleap` fails due to an upgrade being required, the
      information is passed to the user via the CLI (was previously only
      logged).

- Improvements to `wireleap_tun` upgrade logic:
  - `wireleap_tun` binary will now be preserved on upgrades for
    potential rollback without having to re-setup permissions.
  - The user is no longer required to delete `wireleap_tun` manually.

- custom git versions enabled by using envvar `GITVERSION` in
  `contrib/build-bin.sh` if already set.
